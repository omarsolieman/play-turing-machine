# Play Turing Machine

A web-based Turing Machine simulator built with React, Vite, and TypeScript. This project provides an interactive way to learn about and experiment with Turing machines.

## Features

- **Visual Turing Machine Editor**: Create and modify Turing machine states and transitions using a graphical interface.
- **Interactive Tape**: See the Turing machine's tape and head move as it executes.
- **Step-by-step Execution**: Run the machine step-by-step to understand its behavior.
- **State and Transition Management**: Easily add, edit, and delete states and transitions.
- **Example Machines**: Load pre-built example machines to get started quickly.
- **Responsive Design**: Use the simulator on both desktop and mobile devices.
